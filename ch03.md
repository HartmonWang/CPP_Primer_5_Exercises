## 3.2

>Write a program to read the standard input a line at a time.
Modify your program to read a word at a time.

**解答**
see [3.2.cpp](./test/ch03/3.2.cpp)

## 3.3

>Explain how whitespace characters are handled in the string
input operator and in the getline function.

**解答**

- 输入类运算符会跳过空白
- getline会丢弃行尾的换行符

## 3.4

>Write a program to read two strings and report whether the
strings are equal. If not, report which of the two is larger. Now, change
the program to report whether the strings have the same length, and if
not, report which is longer.

**解答**
see [3.4.cpp](./test/ch03/3.4.cpp)

## 3.5

>Write a program to read strings from the standard input,
concatenating what is read into one large string. Print the concatenated
string. Next, change the program to separate adjacent input strings by a
space.

**解答**
see [3.5.cpp](./test/ch03/3.5.cpp)

## 3.6

>Use a range for to change all the characters in a string to X.

**解答**
see [3.6.cpp](./test/ch03/3.6.cpp)

## 3.7

>What would happen if you define the loop control variable in
the previous exercise as type char? Predict the results and then change your
program to use a char to see if you were right.

**解答**

- 设置成`char`, 原字符串不变;
- 设置成`char&`,效果和 `auto&` 一样.

## 3.9

>What does the following program do? Is it valid? If not, why
not?

```cpp
string s;   // 声明了字符串s
cout << s[0] << endl; // 打印s的第一个字符, 该语句非法, 因为s未初始化.
```

## 3.10

>Write a program that reads a string of characters including
punctuation and writes what was read but with the punctuation removed.

**解答**
see [3.10.cpp](./test/ch03/3.10.cpp)

## 3.12

>Which, if any, of the following vector definitions are in
error? For those that are legal, explain what the definition does. For those
that are not legal, explain why they are illegal.
(a) vector<vector<int>> ivec;
(b) vector<string> svec = ivec;
(c) vector<string> svec(10, "null");

**解答**

- a: 正确
- b: 错误,类型不对
- c: 正确

## 3.13

>How many elements are there in each of the following
vectors? What are the values of the elements?
(a) vector<int> v1;
(b) vector<int> v2(10);
(c) vector<int> v3(10, 42);
(d) vector<int> v4{10};
(e) vector<int> v5{10, 42};
(f) vector<string> v6{10};
(g) vector<string> v7{10, "hi"};

**解答**

- a: 0
- b: 10个0
- c: 10个42
- d: 1个, 值为10
- e: 2个,分别为10,42
- f: 10个空字符串
- g: 10个hi字符串

## 3.14

>Write a program to read a sequence of ints from cin and
store those values in a vector.

**解答**
see [3.14.cpp](./test/ch03/3.14.cpp)

## 3.15

>Repeat the previous program but read strings this time.

**解答**
see [3.15.cpp](./test/ch03/3.15.cpp)

## 3.17

>Read a sequence of words from cin and store the values a
vector. After you’ve read all the words, process the vector and change
each word to uppercase. Print the transformed elements, eight words to a
line.

**解答**
see [3.17.cpp](./test/ch03/3.17.cpp)

## 3.18

>Read a set of integers into a vector. Print the sum of each
pair of adjacent elements. Change your program so that it prints the sum of
the first and last elements, followed by the sum of the second and second-tolast,
and so on.

**解答**
see [3.18.cpp](./test/ch03/3.18.cpp)

```bash
➜  ch03 git:(main) ✗ ./3.18
1 2 3 4 5 999
----------------------------------
Sum of v[0]:1 and v[1]:2 is 3
Sum of v[1]:2 and v[2]:3 is 5
Sum of v[2]:3 and v[3]:4 is 7
Sum of v[3]:4 and v[4]:5 is 9
----------------------------------
Sum of v[0]:1 and v[5]:0 is 1
Sum of v[1]:2 and v[4]:5 is 7
Sum of v[0]:1 and v[5]:5 is 6
```

## 3.23

>Write a program to create a vector with ten int elements.
Using an iterator, assign each element a value that is twice its current value.
Test your program by printing the vector.

>In the binary search program on page 112, why did we write
mid = beg + (end - beg) / 2; instead of mid = (beg + end)
/2;?

**解答**
迭代器之间只能相减,不能相加,但是迭代器可以和数值进行加或减.
