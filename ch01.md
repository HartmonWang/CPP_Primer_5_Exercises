# Chapter 1 Getting Started

## 1.1
>Review the documentation for your compiler and determine
what file naming convention it uses. Compile and run the main program from
page 2

**解答**
-  根据g++手册，支持下述形式的C++文件:
```bash
file.cc
file.cp
file.cxx
file.cpp
file.CPP
file.c++
file.C
    C++ source code that must be preprocessed.  Note that in .cxx, the last two letters must both be literally x.  Likewise, .C refers to a literal capital C.
```
- see [1.1.cpp](./test/ch01/1.1.cpp)

## 1.2
>Change the program to return -1. A return value of -1 is
often treated as an indicator that the program failed. Recompile and rerun your program to see how your system treats a failure indicator from main.

**解答**
see [1.2.cpp](./test/ch01/1.2.cpp)

```bash
➜  ch01 git:(main) ✗ ./1.1
➜  ch01 git:(main) ✗ echo $?
0
➜  ch01 git:(main) ✗ ./1.2
➜  ch01 git:(main) ✗ echo $?
255
```

## 1.3
>Write a program to print Hello, World on the standard output.

**解答**
see [1.3.cpp](./test/ch01/1.3.cpp)

## 1.4
>Our program used the addition operator, +, to add two
numbers. Write a program that uses the multiplication operator, *, to print the product instead.

**解答**
see [1.4.cpp](./test/ch01/1.4.cpp)


## 1.5
>We wrote the output in one large statement. Rewrite the
program to use a separate statement to print each operand.

**解答**
see [1.5.cpp](./test/ch01/1.5.cpp)

## 1.6
>Explain whether the following program fragment is legal.
```cpp
std::cout << "The sum of " << v1;
<< " and " << v2;
<< " is " << v1 + v2 << std::endl;
```
>If the program is legal, what does it do? If the program is not legal, why not? How would you fix it?

**解答**

- 不合法，后面两句缺少输出流
- 改成如下形式即可
```cpp
    std::cout << "The multiplication of " << v1;
    std::cout << " and " << v2 << " is ";
    std::cout << v1 * v2 << std::endl;
```

## 1.7
>Compile a program that has incorrectly nested comments.

**解答**
```bash
➜  ch01 git:(main) ✗ make
g++ -Wall -g -std=c++11    1.7.cpp   -o 1.7
1.7.cpp: In function ‘int main()’:
